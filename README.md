> The Projects section of your portfolio should make it easy for prospective employers to see what you've been working on. Separate each project into an individual section or card, and provide links to both the code and the live site.

## Description  

 
- I created a website using Bootstrap and JavaScript that allows me to have a responsive portfolio. This allows you to have the website in various sizes. In the About me section I added a navigation bar at the top that displays my name and links to go to my portfolio, contact page, or back to home. In the about me section I was about to make sure the image was wrapped around a brief about me section. In the contact section I was able to make a form that allows you to enter your name, email address, and lastly a message. Then you would be able to submit this. 
 

#### Technologies
